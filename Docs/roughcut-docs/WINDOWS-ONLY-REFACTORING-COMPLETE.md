# Windows-Only MCP Server Refactoring - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Successfully removed all WSL2 compatibility code from the Remotion MCP server, making it a clean Windows-only application.

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Deleted WSL Compatibility Files
- **Removed**: `src/utils/path-converter.ts` (entire file deleted)
- **Cleaned**: Build artifacts for path-converter

### 2. ✅ Added Build-Time Protection
- **Created**: `scripts/check-platform.js` - Prevents accidental WSL2 builds
- **Updated**: `package.json` prebuild script to run platform check
- **Result**: Build fails immediately if attempted from WSL2

### 3. ✅ Added Runtime Protection  
- **Modified**: `src/index.ts` - Added Windows-only check at startup
- **Result**: MCP server exits if not running on Windows

### 4. ✅ Cleaned Source Files
**Updated files to remove WSL dependencies:**
- `src/utils/config.ts` - Removed path-converter import and WSL path conversion
- `src/utils/safe-spawn.ts` - Removed all WSL path detection/conversion
- `src/tools/studio-tools.ts` - Removed WSL path checks
- `src/utils/platform-fix.ts` - Removed WSL detection logic
- `install-to-claude.js` - Simplified to Windows-only installation

### 5. ✅ Development Workflow Solution
**Added**: `npm run build:dev` command for development builds from WSL2
- Production build (`npm run build`) - Enforces Windows-only
- Development build (`npm run build:dev`) - Bypasses check for testing

## Results

### Before (Complex with WSL support)
- 5 files with WSL-specific code
- ~200 lines of path conversion logic
- Potential edge cases and bugs
- Confusion about execution environment

### After (Clean Windows-only)
- 0 WSL references in source code
- Simpler, more maintainable codebase
- Clear platform requirements
- Build-time safety checks

## Verification
```bash
# No path-converter references
✅ grep -r "path-converter" src/ → No results

# No WSL references  
✅ grep -r "isWSL\|/mnt/" src/ → No results

# TypeScript compiles cleanly
✅ npx tsc --noEmit → No errors

# Platform check works
✅ npm run build (from WSL2) → Correctly blocks with error message
```

## Development Workflow

### For Developers Working in WSL2

**Option 1: Recommended - Separate Terminals**
1. Edit in VSCode/WSL2 (this is fine!)
2. Build in Windows PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   cd "D:\MY PROJECTS\AI\LLM\AI Code Gen\my-builds\Video + Motion\RoughCut"
   npm run build
   ```

**Option 2: Development Build**
```bash
# From WSL2, for development testing only
npm run build:dev
```

**Option 3: Remote Build Script**
Create a script that SSHs to Windows or uses PowerShell remotely.

## Important Notes

1. **Claude Desktop is Windows-only** - The MCP must be built on Windows
2. **Editing in WSL2 is fine** - Just don't build there for production
3. **All paths are Windows paths** - No more `/mnt/d/...` anywhere
4. **Use `build:dev` carefully** - Only for development testing

## Files Modified
- ✅ scripts/check-platform.js (created)
- ✅ package.json
- ✅ src/index.ts
- ✅ src/utils/config.ts
- ✅ src/utils/safe-spawn.ts
- ✅ src/tools/studio-tools.ts
- ✅ src/utils/platform-fix.ts
- ✅ install-to-claude.js
- ❌ src/utils/path-converter.ts (deleted)

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Platform check prevents WSL2 builds
- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [x] No WSL references remain
- [x] Dev build works for testing
- [x] All imports resolved correctly
- [x] Build artifacts cleaned

## Next Steps
1. Always build production code on Windows
2. Use `npm run build:dev` only for development testing
3. Consider setting up a Windows CI/CD pipeline
4. Document this in README for other developers

**Refactoring Complete**: The MCP server is now cleanly Windows-only with no WSL2 dependencies!
