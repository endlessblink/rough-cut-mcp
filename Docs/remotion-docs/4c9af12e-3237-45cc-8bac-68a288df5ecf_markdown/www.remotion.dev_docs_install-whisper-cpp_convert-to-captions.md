This API was deprecated as of Remotion 4.0.216.

It is recommended to use the [`toCaptions()`](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/install-whisper-cpp/to-captions) function from `@remotion/install-whisper-cpp` instead, and then process the captions using [`createTikTokStyleCaptions()`](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/captions/create-tiktok-style-captions) from [`@remotion/captions`](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/captions).

[Click here](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/blob/v4.0.215/packages/docs/docs/install-whisper-cpp/convert-to-captions.mdx) to see documentation for this function that was previously on this page.
