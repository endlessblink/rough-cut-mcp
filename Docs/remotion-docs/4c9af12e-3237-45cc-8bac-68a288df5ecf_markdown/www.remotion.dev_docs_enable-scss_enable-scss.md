_available from v4.0.162_

A function that modifies the default Webpack configuration to make the necessary changes to support SASS/SCSS.

```

remotion.config.ts
ts

import { Config } from "@remotion/cli/config";
import { enableScss } from "@remotion/enable-scss";

Config.overrideWebpackConfig((currentConfiguration) => {
  return enableScss(currentConfiguration);
});
```

If you want to make other configuration changes, you can do so by doing them reducer-style:

```

remotion.config.ts
ts

import { Config } from "@remotion/cli/config";
import { enableScss } from "@remotion/enable-scss";

Config.overrideWebpackConfig((currentConfiguration) => {
  return enableScss({
    ...currentConfiguration,
    // Make other changes
  });
});
```
