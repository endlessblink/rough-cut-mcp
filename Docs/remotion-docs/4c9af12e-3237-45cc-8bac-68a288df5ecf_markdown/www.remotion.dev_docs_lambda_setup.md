**How to set up Remotion Lambda**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFVd3KnfwYY)

## 1\. Install `@remotion/lambda` [â€‹](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/setup\#1-install-remotionlambda "Direct link to 1-install-remotionlambda")

- npm
- yarn
- pnpm
- bun

```

npm i --save-exact @remotion/lambda@4.0.340Copy
```

This assumes you are currently using v4.0.340 of Remotion.

Also update `remotion` and all `` `@remotion/*` `` packages to the same version.

Remove all `^` character in front of the version numbers of it as it can lead to a version conflict.

## 2\. Create role policy [â€‹](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/setup\#2-create-role-policy "Direct link to 2. Create role policy")

- Go to [AWS account IAM Policies section](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?#/policies)
- Click on "Create policy"
- Click on JSON
- In your project, type `npx remotion lambda policies role` in the command line and copy it into the "JSON" field on AWS.
- Click next. Give the policy **exactly** the name `remotion-lambda-policy`. The other fields can be left as they are.
- On the tags page, you don't need to fill in anything. Click next again.

## 3\. Create a role [â€‹](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/setup\#3-create-a-role "Direct link to 3. Create a role")

- Go to [AWS account IAM Roles section](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/roles)
- Click "Create role".
- Under "Use cases", select "Lambda". Click next.
- Under "Permissions policies", filter for `remotion-lambda-policy` and click the checkbox to assign this policy. Click next.
- In the final step, name the role `remotion-lambda-role` **exactly**. You can leave the other fields as is.
- Click "Create role" to confirm.

## 4\. Create a user [â€‹](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/setup\#4-create-a-user "Direct link to 4. Create a user")

- Go to [AWS account IAM Users section](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users)
- Click `Add users`
- Enter any username, such as `remotion-user`.
- **Don't check** the "Enable console access" option. You don't need it.
- Click "Next".
- Click "Next" again without changing any settings. You should now be on the "Review and Create" step.
- Click "Create user".

## 5\. Create an access key for the user [â€‹](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/setup\#5-create-an-access-key-for-the-user "Direct link to 5. Create an access key for the user")

- Go to [AWS account IAM Users section](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users)
- Click on the name of the user that was created in step 4.
- Navigate to the "Security Credentials" tab, and scroll down to the "Access Keys" section.
- Click the "Create access key" button.
- Select "Application running on an AWS compute service".
- Ignore warnings that might appear and check the "I understand the recommendations..." checkbox.
- Click "Next".
- Click "Create access key".
- Add a `.env` file to your project's root and add the credentials you just copied in the following format:

```

.env
txt

REMOTION_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<Access key ID>
REMOTION_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<Secret access key>
```

## 6\. Add permissions to your user [â€‹](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/setup\#6-add-permissions-to-your-user "Direct link to 6. Add permissions to your user")

- Go to [AWS account IAM Users section](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users)
- Select the user you just created.
- Click "Add inline policy" under the "Add Permissions" dropdown in the "Permissions policies" panel.
- Click the tab "JSON".
- Enter in your terminal: `npx remotion lambda policies user` and copy into the AWS text field what gets printed.
- Click "Review policy".
- Give the policy a name. For example `remotion-user-policy`, but it can be anything.
- Click "Create policy" to confirm.

## 7\. Optional: Validate the permission setup [â€‹](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/setup\#7-optional-validate-the-permission-setup "Direct link to 7. Optional: Validate the permission setup")

Check all user permissions and validate them against the AWS Policy simulator by executing the following command:

```

bash

npx remotion lambda policies validate
```

* * *

For the following steps, you may execute them on the CLI, or programmatically using the Node.JS APIs.

## 8\. Deploy a function [â€‹](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/setup\#8-deploy-a-function "Direct link to 8. Deploy a function")

- CLI
- Node.JS

Deploy a function that can render videos into your AWS account by executing the following command:

```

bash

npx remotion lambda functions deploy
```

The function consists of necessary binaries and JavaScript code that can take a [serve URL](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/terminology/serve-url) and make renders from it. A function is bound to the Remotion version, if you upgrade Remotion, you [need to deploy a new function](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/upgrading). A function does not include your Remotion code, it will be deployed in the next step instead.

## 9\. Deploy a site [â€‹](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/setup\#9-deploy-a-site "Direct link to 9. Deploy a site")

- CLI
- Node.JS

Run the following command to deploy your Remotion project to an S3 bucket. Pass as the last argument the [entry point](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/terminology/entry-point) of the project.

```

bash

npx remotion lambda sites create src/index.ts --site-name=my-video
```

A [Serve URL](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/terminology/serve-url) will be printed pointing to the deployed project.

When you update your Remotion code in the future, redeploy your site. Pass the same [`--site-name`](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/cli/sites/create#--site-name) to overwrite the previous deploy. If you don't pass [`--site-name`](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/cli/sites/create#--site-name), a unique URL will be generated on every deploy.

## 10\. Check AWS concurrency limit [â€‹](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/setup\#10-check-aws-concurrency-limit "Direct link to 10. Check AWS concurrency limit")

Check the concurrency limit that AWS has given to your account:

```

npx remotion lambda quotas
```

By default, it is `1000` concurrent invocations per region. However, new accounts might have a limit [as low as `10`](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/troubleshooting/rate-limit#new-accounts-using-aws-lambda). Each Remotion render may use as much as 200 functions per render concurrently, so if your assigned limit is very low, [you might want to request an increase right away](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/troubleshooting/rate-limit#request-an-increase).

## 11\. Render a video [â€‹](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda/setup\#11-render-a-video "Direct link to 11. Render a video")

- CLI
- Node.JS

Take the URL you received from the step 9 - your "serve URL" - and run the following command. Also pass in the [ID of the composition](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/composition) you'd like to render.

```

bash

npx remotion lambda render <serve-url> <composition-id>
```

Progress will be printed until the video finished rendering. Congrats! You rendered your first video using Remotion Lambda ðŸš€
