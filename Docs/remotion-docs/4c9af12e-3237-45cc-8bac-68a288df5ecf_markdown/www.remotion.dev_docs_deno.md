As of right now, Remotion **does not support Deno**.

If you would like to experiment and run Remotion using Deno, you can do so.

For this, we created a way to run the Remotion CLI using Deno (available from v2.0.227):

```

npx remotiond
```

Use `remotiond` instead of the `remotion` command.

It does not matter if you use `npx` or something else as a task runner.

## Permission flags [​](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/deno\#permission-flags "Direct link to Permission flags")

Remotion does not work with Deno is not run with the following permissions:

```

--allow-env --allow-read --allow-write --allow-net --allow-run --allow-sys
```
