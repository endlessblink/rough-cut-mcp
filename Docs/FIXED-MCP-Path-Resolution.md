# ✅ MCP Path Resolution FIXED!

## Problem Solved
The MCP server couldn't find the 31 existing projects because it was using a relative path `'./assets'` which failed when the MCP was executed from different directories.

## The Fix
Changed from:
```javascript
const baseDir = process.env.REMOTION_ASSETS_DIR || './assets';
```

To:
```javascript
const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = dirname(__filename);
const baseDir = process.env.REMOTION_ASSETS_DIR || join(__dirname, 'assets');
```

## Results
- ✅ MCP can now find all 31 projects
- ✅ Path resolution works from any directory
- ✅ Claude Desktop can list and edit existing videos
- ✅ Video editing tools are operational

## Testing Confirmation
```bash
# Test script output:
Found 31 projects:
1. Car Animation
2. cinematic-fresh-1755884520
3. endlessblink-cinematic-showcase
... (and 28 more)
```

## What This Means
Claude Desktop can now:
1. **See all existing projects** using `list-video-projects`
2. **Edit any project** using the video editing tools
3. **Work with absolute paths** regardless of execution context
4. **Find projects reliably** without path resolution errors

## Current Status
- Studio running on port 7501: http://localhost:7501
- 31 projects available for editing
- MCP server fully operational
- Video editing system ready for Claude Desktop
