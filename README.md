### Manual Configuration

Add to your Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rough-cut-mcp": {
      "command": "C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe",
      "args": [
        "C:\\path\\to\\rough-cut-mcp\\build\\index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production",
        "REMOTION_ASSETS_DIR": "D:\\path\\to\\your\\assets"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** 
- **Windows OS** (primary platform, required for full Claude Desktop integration)
- **macOS** (experimental support - see macOS Installation section below)
- **API Keys** for services you want to use:
  - [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) for voice generation
  - [Freesound](https://freesound.org/apiv2/) for sound effects
  - [Black Forest Labs](https://blackforestlabs.ai/) for Flux image generation

## 🍎 macOS Installation (Experimental)

> **⚠️ Experimental Support**: macOS compatibility is provided for sharing purposes. Windows remains the primary platform with full feature support.

### Prerequisites for macOS
- **Node.js 18+** (install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) recommended)
- **Claude Desktop for Mac** (available from [Anthropic](https://claude.ai/))

### Installation on macOS

```bash
# Install Node.js via Homebrew (recommended)
brew install node

# Install the MCP server
npm install -g rough-cut-mcp

# Build the project
cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/rough-cut-mcp
npm run build
```

### macOS Claude Desktop Configuration

Add to your Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json` (typically located at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rough-cut-mcp": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/node",
      "args": [
        "/usr/local/lib/node_modules/rough-cut-mcp/build/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production",
        "REMOTION_ASSETS_DIR": "/Users/yourusername/Documents/rough-cut-assets"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Alternative Node.js Paths on macOS

Depending on your Node.js installation:

```bash
# Homebrew installation
"command": "/usr/local/bin/node"

# Node Version Manager (nvm)
"command": "/Users/yourusername/.nvm/versions/node/v20.x.x/bin/node"

# Official Node.js installer
"command": "/usr/local/bin/node"
```

### macOS Limitations & Known Issues

- **Remotion Studio**: May have launch issues - Windows has better integration
- **File Paths**: Some tools may expect Windows-style paths
- **Performance**: Not optimized for macOS filesystem
- **Testing**: Limited testing compared to Windows platform

### Getting Your Node.js Path on macOS

```bash
# Find your Node.js installation
which node

# Verify Node.js version
node --version
```

### macOS Asset Directory Setup

```bash
# Create asset directory
mkdir -p ~/Documents/rough-cut-assets

# Set permissions
chmod 755 ~/Documents/rough-cut-assets
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your assets directory:

```env
# Required for voice generation
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_key_here

# Required for sound effects
FREESOUND_API_KEY=your_freesound_key_here

# Required for image generation  
FLUX_API_KEY=your_flux_key_here
```

### Tool Organization

The MCP server uses a **layered tool architecture** for better performance:

- **Discovery Tools** (always active): Tool management and exploration
- **Core Operations** (default): Basic project and studio operations
- **On-Demand Categories**: Video creation, voice generation, image tools, etc.

## 🎯 Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Discover Available Tools**:
   ```
   Use "discover-capabilities" to see all tool categories
   ```

2. **Activate Tool Categories**:
   ```
   Use "activate-toolset" to load specific tool sets:
   - video-creation
   - studio-management
   - voice-generation (requires API key)
   - sound-effects (requires API key)
   - image-generation (requires API key)
   ```

3. **Create and Edit Videos**:
   ```
   - "create-complete-video" - Generate full video projects
   - "launch-project-studio" - Open Remotion Studio for editing
   - "edit-video-element" - Programmatically modify video elements
   ```

### Example Commands

```bash
# List all video projects
"list-video-projects"

# Create a new animated video
"create-complete-video" with parameters:
{
  "name": "my-awesome-video",
  "template": "text-animation",
  "duration": 300
}

# Launch Remotion Studio for a specific project
"launch-project-studio" with parameters:
{
  "projectName": "my-awesome-video"
}
```

- First launch assigns a port (7400-7600 range)
- Subsequent launches reuse the same port
- Metadata stored in `.studio-metadata.json`

### Smart Tool Loading
The layered architecture improves performance:
- Initial load: 9 tools instead of 40+
- Dynamic loading based on needs
- Reduced context and faster responses

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Tools not appearing after activation**  
A: Check that the MCP server is running and Claude Desktop configuration is correct.

**Q: Remotion Studio won't launch**  
A: Ensure you're on Windows and have Node.js 18+ installed. Check port availability (7400-7600).

**Q: API-dependent tools missing**  
A: Verify API keys are set in environment variables or config.

**Q: Build fails on non-Windows platforms**  
A: Windows is the primary platform. macOS support is experimental - see macOS Installation section.
