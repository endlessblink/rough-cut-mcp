### ✅ **Phase 4: Studio Integration - SUCCESS WITH MINOR ISSUES**

**Studio Launch Capabilities**:
- ✅ Project structure validation working
- ✅ Dependency installation (426 packages) successful
- ✅ Port management and allocation functional
- ✅ Process tracking and monitoring operational
- ✅ Network binding (localhost + network interface) working

**Issues Identified**:
- ⚠️ JSX syntax errors in generated code (quote escaping problems)
- ⚠️ Font family string literals require proper quote handling
- ✅ Studio launches successfully despite compilation errors
- ✅ Hot reload and rebuild system functional

**Studio Performance**:
- **Startup Time**: 8-10 seconds from command to "Server ready"
- **Build Time**: ~2.6 seconds initial compilation
- **Rebuild Time**: ~1.5 seconds for changes

**Root Cause**: Font family declarations have incorrect quote escaping:
```typescript
// Incorrect (causes build error):
fontFamily: 'SF Pro Display'", -apple-system, sans-serif',

// Correct format needed:
fontFamily: '"SF Pro Display", -apple-system, sans-serif',
```
