# Claude Code Session Memory & Drop-off: RoughCut MCP Artifacts Workflow

**Date**: September 4, 2025  
**Project**: rough-cut-mcp - Simplified architecture breakthrough  
**Status**: Major simplification completed, testing Artifacts-to-Remotion workflow  

---

## üéØ **Current Project Context**

### **Major Breakthrough: 90% Code Reduction**
- **Before**: 2,718 line tools.ts with complex enhancement systems causing failures
- **After**: 279 line tools.ts with 4 simple tools that trust Claude's design intelligence
- **Commit**: `28265a5` - "Simplified MCP architecture with brutal honesty principles"

### **Working Architecture**
```
/mnt/d/MY PROJECTS/AI/LLM/AI Code Gen/my-builds/Video + Motion/rough-cut-mcp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/tools.ts              # SIMPLIFIED: 4 basic tools only
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/utils.ts              # CLEANED: trusts Claude's JSX directly  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md                 # UPDATED: brutal honesty principles added
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/complex-systems/  # All failed enhancement systems
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-claude-natural/      # PROVEN WORKING EXAMPLE (Frame 289)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ perfect-github-showcase.tsx # Manual conversion test
```

### **Simple MCP Tools (Working)**
- `create_project` - Takes Claude's JSX exactly as provided, no template overrides
- `edit_project` - Replaces VideoComposition.tsx with new JSX from Claude  
- `launch_studio` - Starts Remotion Studio for project
- `read_project` - Shows current VideoComposition.tsx content to Claude

## üß† **Like-I-Said Memory (User Preferences)**

### **Critical User Requirements**
1. **"Stop theoretical fixes"** - User wants evidence-based development only
2. **"Be brutally honest"** - Stop proposing solutions without testing basics
3. **"Don't use port 3001"** - Use port 7080 for testing (multiple studios running)
4. **Artifacts-to-Remotion workflow** - User wants seamless conversion without manual steps

### **User's Vision**
```
User: "Create GitHub showcase animation"
‚Üì 
Claude: [Auto-creates excellent React Artifact]
‚Üì
MCP: [Auto-converts to Remotion + video enhancements] 
‚Üì
Result: High-quality video without conversion prompts
```

### **Quality Standards (From User Examples)**
- Rich animated backgrounds with moving gradients
- Floating particles systems with realistic motion
- GitHub contribution graphs (53x7 grids)  
- Glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur
- Professional data structures and real content
- Dynamic time-based animations with state management

### **What User Rejected**
- ‚ùå Complex validation systems (quote safety, layout intelligence)
- ‚ùå Template-based approaches that constrain Claude  
- ‚ùå Over-engineering without testing basics first
- ‚ùå "Copy template" approaches (defeats purpose of AI generation)

## üé¨ **Drop-off Prompt for New Session**

```
I'm continuing work on the RoughCut MCP project - a Remotion video generation system that was simplified after complex enhancement systems failed.

PROJECT LOCATION: /mnt/d/MY PROJECTS/AI/LLM/AI Code Gen/my-builds/Video + Motion/rough-cut-mcp

CURRENT STATE: Major breakthrough completed - reduced from 2,718 line tools.ts to 279 lines by removing all complex systems that constrained Claude's design intelligence. Simple MCP now trusts Claude's JSX directly.

PROVEN WORKING: test-claude-natural/Frame 289 shows excellent quality possible with sequential Sequence components, rich animations, professional spacing.

CURRENT OBJECTIVE: Implement seamless Artifacts-to-Remotion workflow where:
1. User requests animation ‚Üí Claude creates React Artifact ‚Üí MCP auto-converts to Remotion
2. User edits ‚Üí Claude updates Artifact ‚Üí MCP syncs Remotion automatically  
3. No manual conversion steps required

CRITICAL PRINCIPLE: Following "brutal honesty" - test basics before building complex workflows. Must prove manual Artifact-to-Remotion conversion works before automation.

ACTIVE LIKE-I-SAID TASKS:
- TASK-94109 (URGENT): Test basic Artifacts-to-Remotion conversion manually
- TASK-93222 (HIGH): Implement seamless workflow after basics proven
- TASK-27855 (HIGH): Build React-to-Remotion translation engine

Continue with current task of manually converting React Artifacts to Remotion to validate quality preservation before building automation.
```

## üîç **Quick Verification Commands**

```bash
# Verify project location
cd "/mnt/d/MY PROJECTS/AI/LLM/AI Code Gen/my-builds/Video + Motion/rough-cut-mcp"

# Check current tasks
mcp__like-i-said__list_tasks --project rough-cut-mcp-artifacts

# Verify simplified build
ls src/  # Should show: index.ts, tools.ts, utils.ts only

# Check working example  
ls test-claude-natural/  # Frame 289 proven example

# Verify studio on port 7080
curl -s http://localhost:7080 || echo "Studio not running"

# Latest commit
git log --oneline -1  # Should show simplified architecture commit
```

## üìã **Next Steps (In Priority Order)**

### **URGENT - Following Brutal Honesty Principle**
1. **Test manual Artifact-to-Remotion conversion**
   - Use existing React Artifact (`artifact-to-remotion-test.tsx`)
   - Manually convert useState ‚Üí frame-based, Tailwind ‚Üí inline styles
   - Validate quality is preserved in conversion
   - Document what works vs what breaks

### **AFTER MANUAL TESTING SUCCEEDS**
2. **Build translation patterns** based on proven manual conversion
3. **Implement automatic detection** for video/animation keywords
4. **Create smart editing sync** between Artifacts and Remotion
5. **Test complete seamless workflow**

### **IF MANUAL TESTING FAILS**  
- Investigate why Artifacts can't be reliably converted
- Consider alternative approaches (browser recording, different video tech)
- Document limitations and adjust strategy

---

## üö® **Critical Context**

### **Why Previous Approaches Failed**
- Complex enhancement systems added layers without solving core issues
- Template overrides prevented Claude from using natural design intelligence
- Quote safety/layout intelligence were symptoms, not root cause fixes
- Every "intelligent" system introduced new failure modes

### **Current Success Formula**
- Simple MCP tools that don't override Claude's creativity
- Trust Claude's natural design abilities (proven in Artifacts)
- Test basics before building automation
- Focus on seamless user experience over technical complexity

### **Evidence of Quality Possible**
- Frame 289 screenshot shows professional results achievable
- User's React Artifacts examples show target quality level  
- Remotion has stable Tailwind support and rich animation capabilities
- Conversion IS possible, just needs to be done right

**Continue with manual Artifacts-to-Remotion testing to validate approach before building automation.**
